# üõ∏ Drone Transmitter ‚Äì Arduino Nano + NRF24L01

This sketch reads joystick inputs from two analog joysticks and transmits the control data wirelessly using the NRF24L01 module. The control values include **throttle**, **yaw**, **pitch**, and **roll** ‚Äì essential for quadcopter flight control.

## üì¶ Features

- Reads analog input from 4 joystick axes
- Maps each value to the ESC-friendly range (1000‚Äì2000)
- Packs control data into a structured `ControlPacket`
- Sends the packet via NRF24L01 module using the RF24 library
- Serial Monitor output for testing/debugging

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Nano (or Uno)
- 2x Joystick Modules (with X/Y axes) - Try the joystick (Since we haven't gotten our NRF Module (future development))
- 
- NRF24L01 Module (transmitter side)
- Capacitor (10¬µF‚Äì100¬µF) across VCC and GND of NRF
- Jumper wires, breadboard

## üîå Pin Connections

| Function        | Arduino Pin | Notes                  |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Throttle Axis   | A0          | Joystick vertical (left stick) |
| Yaw Axis        | A1          | Joystick horizontal (left stick) |
| Pitch Axis      | A2          | Joystick vertical (right stick) |
| Roll Axis       | A3          | Joystick horizontal (right stick) |

Not Yet Since we haven't gotten our NRF Module (future development)
| NRF CE          | D9          | Connect to CE pin on NRF24L01 |
| NRF CSN         | D10         | Connect to CSN pin on NRF24L01 |
| NRF VCC         | 3.3V        | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not use 5V** |
| NRF GND         | GND         | Shared with Arduino GND |
